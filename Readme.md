This is gerber file for the transistor tracer circuit designed & published by Peter Balch: https://www.instructables.com/id/Transistor-Curve-Tracer/

I have made few adjustments to Peter Balch's project to fit my needs: 
	- I feed it with 5V via a barrel connector (I have a lot of 5V battery packs hanging around)
	- I have used an arduino nano with the USB-to-serial interface on board, to avoid the FTI programmer (and again, to use what I had already at home).

This was my FIRST pcb design, learning to use EasyEDA so ... today I would do it much better (I made 2 errors, they have no impact, just annoying).
